Secure Remote Password (SRP) for Swift (Thinbus compatible)
======================================

Secure Remote Password is a authentication protocol to prove your identity to
another party, using a password, but without ever revealing that password to
other parties. Not even the party you are proving your identity. See [Secure Remote Password protocol][5] for more information on this protocol.
